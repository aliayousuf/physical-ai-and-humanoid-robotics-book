# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces how humanoid robots think, communicate, and control their bodies using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). You'll learn the fundamentals of robot middleware, communication patterns, and how to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:
- Understand ROS 2 as the communication backbone for robots
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Define humanoid structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Build your first ROS 2 packages and launch files

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main sections:

1. **Concepts**: Theoretical foundations of ROS 2
2. **Workflows**: Practical implementation approaches
3. **Examples**: Hands-on exercises and code samples

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 middleware for robot control
- Communication patterns: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Python integration with rclpy
- Robot description with URDF
- Package creation and launch file configuration

## Next Steps

Start with the [ROS 2 Middleware Fundamentals](./concepts/ros2-middleware) to learn about the core concepts of ROS 2 communication.
