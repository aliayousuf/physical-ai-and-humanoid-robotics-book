# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module teaches physics-accurate humanoid simulation and environment building. You'll learn how to create digital twins of robots that accurately represent their physical counterparts in simulation environments.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:
- Understand Gazebo physics: gravity, collisions, rigid body dynamics
- Work with URDF/SDF simulation of humanoid robots
- Implement sensor simulation: LiDAR, IMU, Depth/Camera
- Create visualization and human-robot interaction scenes in Unity

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D visualization concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main sections:

1. **Concepts**: Theoretical foundations of simulation
2. **Workflows**: Practical implementation approaches
3. **Examples**: Hands-on exercises and code samples

## Topics Covered

- Gazebo physics simulation and environment setup
- URDF/SDF integration for robot simulation
- Sensor simulation and data processing
- Unity for visualization and interaction

## Next Steps

Start with [Gazebo Physics Fundamentals](./concepts/gazebo-physics) to learn about physics simulation principles.
