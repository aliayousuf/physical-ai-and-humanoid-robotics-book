# Agent Context: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive Docusaurus-based book covering Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. The book is structured in four major modules covering ROS 2, Digital Twin simulation, NVIDIA Isaac AI pipelines, and Vision-Language-Action integration.

## Technology Stack
- Docusaurus: Static site generator for documentation
- ROS 2: Robot Operating System for communication and control
- Gazebo: Physics simulation environment
- Unity: Visualization and human-robot interaction
- NVIDIA Isaac: AI and computer vision tools for robotics
- Navigation2 (Nav2): Path planning and navigation
- LLMs: Large language models for cognitive planning

## Key Concepts
- Physical AI: Integration of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems
- Humanoid Robotics: Robots with human-like form and capabilities
- Digital Twin: Virtual representation of physical robot systems
- VLA (Vision-Language-Action): Integration of visual perception, language understanding, and physical action
- Sim-to-Real: Transfer of capabilities from simulation to real-world robots

## Documentation Structure
- Module 1: ROS 2 fundamentals (middleware, nodes, topics, services, actions, rclpy, URDF)
- Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo physics, URDF/SDF, sensor simulation, Unity visualization)
- Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, reinforcement learning)
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (LLMs for planning, multi-modal fusion, capstone project)

## Content Standards
- Follow conceptual → technical → applied progression in each chapter
- Include practical examples with downloadable code
- Provide clear learning objectives and outcomes
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include diagrams and visual aids where appropriate

## User Personas
- Students: Learning robotics concepts and implementation
- Researchers: Exploring advanced robotics techniques
- Engineers: Implementing robotic systems
- Educators: Teaching robotics courses

## Navigation Patterns
- Sequential learning from basic to advanced concepts
- Cross-references between related concepts across modules
- Prerequisite indicators for each module/chapter
- Search functionality for targeted information retrieval
- Glossary for terminology reference

## Special Considerations
- Complex technical content requires clear explanations
- Integration of multiple complex robotics frameworks
- Need for hands-on practical examples
- Balancing theoretical concepts with practical implementation
- Supporting diverse learning styles and backgrounds
