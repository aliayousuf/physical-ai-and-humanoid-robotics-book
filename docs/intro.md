# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This book bridges the gap between digital artificial intelligence and physical robotics systems, preparing you for the future of embodied intelligence.

## About This Book

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of Robot Operating System 2, the middleware that connects all robotic components.

2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master simulation environments that allow you to test and develop robotics applications in virtual worlds.

3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Simulation & AI)** - Implement AI-powered robotics with NVIDIA's advanced platforms for perception and control.

4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models** - Integrate the latest in multimodal AI to create robots that understand and respond to natural language commands.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python and/or C++)
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with Linux command line (recommended)

Don't worry if you're not an expert in all these areas - we'll provide resources to help you learn as needed.

## Learning Approach

This book follows a hands-on approach where theory is immediately followed by practical implementation. Each module contains:
- Core concepts and theory
- Practical workflows and implementation guides
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Interactive exercises and projects

## Getting Started

Start with Module 1 to build a strong foundation, or jump to a specific module that interests you most. Each module is designed to be accessible individually, though following the sequence provides the most comprehensive learning experience.
