# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module focuses on building perception, navigation, and manipulation pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac tools. You'll learn how to create AI systems that allow robots to perceive their environment, plan navigation paths, and manipulate objects.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:
- Use Isaac Sim for photorealistic training and synthetic data generation
- Implement Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid path planning
- Apply reinforcement learning techniques with sim-to-real foundations

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of basic AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with computer vision fundamentals
- Experience with ROS 2 and simulation environments

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main sections:

1. **Concepts**: Theoretical foundations of AI robotics
2. **Workflows**: Practical implementation approaches
3. **Examples**: Hands-on exercises and code samples

## Topics Covered

- Isaac Sim for synthetic data and training
- Isaac ROS for accelerated perception
- Nav2 for navigation and path planning
- Reinforcement learning for robot behavior

## Next Steps

Start with [Isaac Sim Introduction](./concepts/isaac-sim) to learn about synthetic data generation and training.
